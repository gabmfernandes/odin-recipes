# Odin Recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

It is a simple recipe website built only with **HTML**.  
The site consists of a main page (`index.html`) with links to individual recipe pages.

## Features
- Main index page with navigation links
- Individual recipe pages with:
  - Title and description
  - Image of the dish
  - List of ingredients
  - Step-by-step instructions
- Simple navigation back to the home page

## Skills Learned
While building this project, I practiced and learned:
- Setting up a basic HTML project structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Creating relative links between pages
- Inserting images with the `<img>` tag and adjusting their dimensions
- Organizing content with semantic HTML
- Writing meaningful commit messages and using Git/GitHub
